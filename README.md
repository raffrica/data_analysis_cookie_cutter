# Cookie Cutter for Data Analysis Project Structure


See `cookie_cutter.sh` script attached - running this bash script will create the data analysis project structure in the directory it is run into. 

* Script will prompt for the name of the project - please use proper naming conventions (no whitespace, avoid camelcase). Use `_` if more than one word long. 

* Directory containing `cookie_cutter.sh` must be added to the PATH. This can be done by: 

> 1. search within home directory for a variation of `.bash_`. Mine is `.bash_profile`. 
> 2. Here add the directory to your bash profile with: `export PATH="~/PATH_TO_YOUR_DIRECTORY:$PATH"`

* Script will create the following project structure<sup>1</sup>:
